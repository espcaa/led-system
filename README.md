# Leds are fun!

Created this project in 4h to drive a very long led strip i got at (scrapyard)[https://scrapyard.hackclub.com]. I didn't have any psu or mosfets to drive it, so I created this pcb.

## Features

- has cool art
- has shiny mosfets
- has an esp32-f to control your leds wirelessly
- maybe works
- made by me
